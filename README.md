# SAVI - Class Exercises

---

Exercises solved during the classes of [Advanced Industrial Visualization Systems (**S**istemas **A**vançados de **V**isualização **I**ndustrial)](https://github.com/miguelriemoliveira/savi_23-24). These are divided in several parts, focusing mainly on three key areas. All the programming developed during this course is based on **Python**.

The initial segment delves into image processing and computer vision using standard RGB images. Here, the [**OpenCV**](https://opencv.org/) library is the main object of study, helping to solve the problems in question.

The second segment revolves around the manipulation and processing of 3D data, more specifically information presented as point clouds. To achieve this, the library [**Open3D**](https://www.open3d.org/) is used to be able process the data, such as finding planes through RANSAC algorithms, or even finding clusters of points, being therefore able to detect and isolate objects in a scene.

In the latter sections of this subject, **deep learing** was used to create a model to classify different images images into distinct categories. This was made possible using the [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/) library. The exercises solved in these last few parts were based on the [Pytorch CNN tutorial with cats and dogs](https://www.kaggle.com/code/reukki/pytorch-cnn-tutorial-with-cats-and-dogs).
